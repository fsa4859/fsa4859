### About me

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a master's candidate in robotics at New York University and a mapping and localization engineer at Nokia Bell Labs. With a focus on 3D computer vision, structure from motion pipeline, feature matching, point cloud registration, and machine learning, I'm passionate about developing cutting-edge technologies that enable robots to operate in challenging environments. My proficiency in Python, C++, and MATLAB has allowed me to contribute to a variety of projects in the robotics industry. I'm always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and collaborate with others in this exciting field. Please check my portfolio [https://fsa4859.github.io/](url)
